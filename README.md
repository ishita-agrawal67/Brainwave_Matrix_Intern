Amazon Sales Data Analysis Project Overview ---

Project Description--
This project aims to analyze and visualize Amazon sales data to gain insights into sales performance, customer behavior, and product trends. The analysis involves loading 
the dataset, cleaning and preprocessing the data, and performing exploratory data analysis (EDA) using Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn.

Goals--
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handle missing values, convert data types, and normalize data.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conduct thorough analysis to understand the data structure, identify trends, and uncover patterns.
Data Visualization: Create various plots and charts to visualize key metrics related to sales, customers, and products.
Insights and Reporting: Generate insights from the analysis and present them in an easily understandable format.

Key Features--

Data Cleaning: Handle missing values by removing or imputing them. Convert data types for better analysis and computation. Normalize numerical data for improved model 
performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Summarize data using descriptive statistics. Group and aggregate data to identify trends and patterns. Analyze sales by product category, 
region, and time period.

Data Visualization: Count plots, histograms, and pie charts to represent categorical data distributions. Scatter plots to visualize relationships between different variables.
Heatmaps to show correlations and confusion matrices for classification tasks.

Libraries and Tools Used --
Pandas: For data manipulation and analysis.
NumPy: For numerical operations and array manipulations.
Matplotlib: For creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
Seaborn: For making statistical graphics more attractive and informative.

Dataset-- The dataset used in this project is the Amazon Sales Report, which includes the following columns:
order_id, product_id, product_name, category, quantity, price, order_date, customer_id, ship-postal-code, ship-state, B2B, Size, Status, Courier Status

Conclusion:
This project demonstrates how to use Python for data analysis and visualization, providing valuable insights into Amazon's sales data. By following the steps outlined 
in the project, you can replicate the analysis and adapt it to your datasets and requirements.
